Patch 0.1
Things that have been worked on.

Created an Agent Generate Function that contains the trait values of both males and females using a rough Genetics system. AS well as having agents assigned a sex and an ID# 
*Had to create 100 agents becuase the rows and columns were bugging hard.

What is being worked on/could use some guidence on.
*Creating a line of code that returns the male agent with the highest trait value and their ID. (So far I can only produce the male agent with the highest TV but am struggling with ID)
*Creating a reproduction function for offspring
